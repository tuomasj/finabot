## Current status

- Please understand that this is just an experimental bot, run this at your own risk
- Works on just channel per bot (and fills my use case perfectly)
- Code is just one big file
- Class `Finabot` has just too many responsibilities
- Uses Yahoo Finance API through `basic_yahoo_finance` gem
- Not tested on Telegram channels
- Probably works just on happy case path
- It does not have any error handling, it just crashes

## How to run this

### Running locally

If you want to run this locally without connecting to Telegram, use `--cli` option.

```
    $ ruby finabot.rb --cli
```

or running from command-line, but it does not look good to my eye.

```
    $ ruby finabot.rb /help
    $ ruby finabot.rb /latest
```

Same commands work, so start with `/help`.

### Running as Telegram bot

- Create the bot on Telegram (Telegram Bots)[https://core.telegram.org/bots]
- Grab the Telegram API token
- Make the bot Inline so it replies on the group (like Irc bots back in the day)
- Invite the bot to a channel
- Start the finabot with command-line argument `--telegram`

```
    $ API_TOKEN=<your-telegram-api-token> ruby finabot.rb --telegram
```

- Test with `/help` command, type it on the group and the bot should print the list of available commands. Remember, you run the bot at your own risk.

## Persisted Ticker Symbols

When starting the bot, it loads the ticker symbols from `tickers.txt`. Finabot saves the ticker symbols into same file when ticker symbols are added or removed.
